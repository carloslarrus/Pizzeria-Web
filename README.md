# Pizzeria-Web
I use React library for the front end and for the back end I use mongoose. Moreover for adding, creating, deleting or updating pizzas I use Insomnia, sending the pizzas to the pizza collection. The front end will take the pizzas from the mongodb and it will place them inside of a card. Once the customer makes a order it will be send to the database following the order schema, all the orders will be place on the order collection# Pizzeria-Web.
